# 2024-SmallData-Project
### TODO:
* First Stage: 
    * Create test set with sound and images
    * Create pure audio set for training audio-only model
    * Create pure image set for training image only model
    * Implement image+audio model, image-only model, audio-only model. 
    * Training and evaluation of all the models (accuracy, t-SNE)
* Second Stage: 
    * Training model with different amount of data(5 images/audios per class, 10 images/audios per class, 20 images/audios per class)
    * Evaluate scalability our model trained with audio + image
* Third Stage: 
    * Add noise for both images and audios:  Gaussian Noise with different levels
    * Evaluate robustness of models training with noise (performance drop?)
